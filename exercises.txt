The exercises I am using for this coding challenge repo can be found across the internet.

They mainly come from HackerRank.com and CodeWars.com

I'm always up for a fun little challenge, and will be adding to this repo when I come across 
something that fits in the category or maybe when a job interview has me code something different.
